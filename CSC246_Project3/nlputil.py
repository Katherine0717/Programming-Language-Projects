# File: nlputil.py
# Purpose: A collection of utility methods for working with text data.
# Author: Adam Purtee (starter code for CSC 246 Spring 2021 third Project)
#
#
# This file contains three kinds of methods for each of the following tasks:
#  o building a vocabulary -- this obtains a dictionary from tokens to integers
#  o converting to integers -- this converts a sample to a sequence of integers
#  o converting to one-hot -- this converts a sample to a sequence of one-hot vectors
#                             (i.e., this maps strings to matrices).
#
# There are parallel methods included for working with either word-based or character-based models.
# In both cases, unknown words will always map to integer value 0. 

# Note -- File IO is slow, so it's best if you can keep as much data in RAM as possible.
# Converting to a word-based one-hot representation is EXTREMELY memory intensive (many huge vectors of ints).
# Converting to a character-based one-hot representation is also expensive (more vectors, but smaller dimension).
# The most memory efficient implementation would probably read all of the data into RAM, leave it as a gigantic
# python list of strings, and do vocabulary lookup on the fly during learning/inference.
# The fastest implementation would precompute as much stuff as possible.


# A vocabulary for this project is a dictionary from tokens to unique integers.
#
# This will simply assign each unique word in the data a unique integer, starting with one
# and increasing until all words are processed.  The exact results depend on the order in
# which the paths are presented to the method.  Renaming the files may also change the order.
#
# paths -- a list of paths to directories containing data.  paths represented as strings)
